2. Fork the repo

3. Create the venv
	python -m venv env
	google commands to activate

4. pip install djangorestframework

5. install PostgreSQL (THIS WILL TAKE A LONG TIME)
	- Windows: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
	- Mac: https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/
	- Linux: https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/

6. Activate the venv and install psycopg2
	pip install psycopg2-binary

7. Access the PostgreSQL shell by cd into 'directory you installed it to'/bin

8. run the following SQL commands:
	CREATE USER myprojectuser WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
	CREATE DATABASE myprojectdb OWNER myprojectuser;
  	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE myprojectdb TO myprojectuser;
	\q

	replace myprojectuser with whatever username you want, same for the password
	replace myprojectdb with studygatchi_db

9. Create a file called settings.py in the backend directory and copy and paste the contents of settings_template.txt into settings.py.

10. On settings.py, go to where it says DATABASES, and insert your info from step 8 into the corresponding places.

11. Run the following commands with the venv active to apply migrations:
	python manage.py makemigrations
	python manage.py migrate

12. Test the connection by running this command
